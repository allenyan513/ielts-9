## 📌 1. 向朋友推荐一位保姆或家教

### 题目：

**Your friend is looking for a babysitter or private tutor for their child. Write a letter to recommend someone. In your letter:**

* explain who the person is
* describe their experience and skills
* say why you think they would be suitable

### 范文：

**Dear Jessica,**

I hope everything is going well with you and your little one! I remember you mentioning that you were looking for a reliable babysitter for Emma, so I wanted to recommend someone I think would be a great fit.

Her name is Rachel Liu, and she has been helping me take care of my son for the past year. Rachel is a certified early childhood educator and has over five years of experience working with children between the ages of 2 and 8. She is patient, trustworthy, and incredibly creative — she always finds fun ways to engage children through games, reading, and crafts.

What I appreciate most is her ability to connect with kids and create a safe, nurturing environment. Emma would absolutely love her. If you’d like, I can help arrange a short trial session to see how it goes.

Let me know what you think!

Warm regards,

**Sophie**

## 📌 2. 推荐一本书、一个地方或一家餐厅

### 题目：

**You recently visited a place or read a book you really enjoyed. Write a letter to a friend to recommend it. In your letter:**

* describe the book/place/restaurant
* explain why you liked it
* say why your friend should try it too

### 范文：

**Dear Daniel,**

I just finished reading a book that I think you would absolutely love — it’s called *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. Knowing your interest in personal development, this book is right up your alley.

It’s all about how small daily habits, when done consistently, can lead to big, lasting changes. What I really liked is how practical and well-structured the advice is — the author breaks down the psychology of behavior change in a very relatable way, using real-life examples and simple strategies.

I remember we talked about struggling to build a workout routine — this book gives you a clear plan to make that stick. I found it inspiring and easy to apply right away. You should definitely give it a read; I think it’ll motivate you just as much as it did me.

Let me know what you think if you get the chance to read it!

Best,

**Alex**

## 📌 3. 写信介绍新同事或新邻居

### 题目：

**You have a new colleague or neighbour who has recently moved in. Write a letter to introduce them to your other friend or colleague. In your letter:**

* introduce the new person
* describe their background and interests
* explain how they might get along

### 范文：

**Dear Priya,**

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to introduce you to my new neighbour, Mark Nguyen, who recently moved into the apartment next door. Since you both share similar interests, I thought you might enjoy meeting him.

Mark is originally from Vancouver and just relocated here for work — he’s a graphic designer at a creative agency downtown. He’s friendly, easygoing, and loves photography and hiking, just like you! In fact, he mentioned he's looking for local trails to explore, and I immediately thought of you as the perfect person to show him around.

He's also into board games and good coffee, so you two should have no problem finding common ground. I’m planning to have a small get-together this weekend and would love for you to join so you can meet him.

Let me know if you're free!

Cheers,

**Lina**
