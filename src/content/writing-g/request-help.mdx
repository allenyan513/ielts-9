## 1. 请求邻居在你外出时帮忙照看房子/宠物


### 题目
You are going to be away from home for a few weeks and would like your neighbor to help you look after your house and pet.
Write a letter to your neighbor. In your letter:

- explain the reason for your absence
- ask them to take care of your house and pet
- offer them something in return

Write at least 150 words.

### 范文
Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to ask if you would be willing to help me while I’m away on a short trip next month.

I’ll be visiting my family in Montreal from October 10th to 24th and will be leaving my house unoccupied during that time. I was wondering if you could keep an eye on the place and, more importantly, look after my cat, Luna. She’s very independent but needs to be fed twice a day and enjoys a bit of company in the evenings.

If you’re available, I’d be happy to leave you a spare key and written instructions for her food and care. Of course, I’d love to bring you back something special from Montreal as a thank-you — just let me know if there’s anything you’d like!

Please let me know if this would be convenient for you.

Warm regards,

Anna Chen



## 2. 请求朋友推荐一份兼职工作
### 题目
You are looking for a part-time job and want your friend to help you find one.
Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:

- explain why you are looking for a part-time job
- describe the type of work you would like to do
- ask your friend to help you find a job

### 范文
Dear Jason,

I hope everything's going well with you. I’m writing to ask if you could help me find a part-time job in your area.

As you know, I’ve just started my master's program at the university, and although I’m enjoying the course, the tuition and living expenses are quite high. I’m hoping to find a part-time job to help cover some of my costs and gain some local experience as well.

Ideally, I’d like something flexible, like working in a café, bookstore, or even doing administrative tasks at a small office. I’m available most evenings and weekends, and I have experience in customer service back home.

If you happen to hear of any openings or know someone hiring, I’d really appreciate it if you could pass along my contact details or let me know.

Looking forward to catching up soon.

Best,

Michelle

## 3. 请求公司调整工作时间
### 题目
You want to request a change in your work schedule.
Write a letter to your manager. In your letter:

- explain why you need the change
- describe the new schedule you prefer
- say how you think the change will affect your work
### 范文
Dear Mr. Patel,

I hope you’re well. I’m writing to formally request a change in my current work schedule due to some changes in my personal circumstances.

Starting next month, I will be attending evening classes as part of a professional certification program. These classes run from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays. To accommodate this, I would like to shift my work hours slightly — starting at 8:00 a.m. and finishing by 4:30 p.m., instead of the current 9-to-6 schedule.

I believe this adjustment will not affect my productivity. In fact, starting earlier may allow me to complete most of my tasks before the office gets busy in the afternoon. I will also make sure to coordinate with my team to ensure a smooth transition.

I appreciate your understanding and hope we can find a suitable arrangement.

Sincerely,

Alicia Wong


## 4. 请求大学提供住宿安排
### 题目
You will be attending a university and would like to request accommodation.
Write a letter to the university. In your letter:

- introduce yourself
- explain why you need university accommodation
- ask about the type of accommodation available

### 范文
Dear Housing Office,

My name is Ahmed Khan, and I have recently been accepted into the Master’s program in Environmental Science at your university for the upcoming academic year.

As I will be moving from overseas, I would like to request on-campus accommodation. It would be much more convenient to stay close to the university during my first year while I get used to the new environment and focus on my studies. I am also unfamiliar with the local rental process, so staying in university housing would give me some peace of mind.

Could you please provide details regarding the types of accommodation available, including costs, room types, and application deadlines? I would prefer a single room with access to a shared kitchen if possible.

I look forward to your response and thank you in advance for your assistance.

Yours faithfully,

Ahmed Khan
