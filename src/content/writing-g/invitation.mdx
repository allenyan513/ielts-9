## 1. 邀请朋友参加婚礼


### 题目

You are getting married soon and would like to invite a friend from another city to attend the wedding.
Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:

- tell your friend about the wedding plans
- explain why you want your friend to attend
- give information about accommodation or travel arrangements



### 范文
Dear Anna,

I hope you and your family are doing well. I’m writing to share some exciting news — James and I are getting married next month, and I would be absolutely delighted if you could attend our wedding.

The ceremony will take place on Saturday, July 20th, at the Lakeside Chapel in Toronto, followed by a reception at The Grand Ballroom. As one of my closest friends from university, your presence would mean a lot to me on such an important day. We’ve shared so many memories over the years, and I can’t imagine this special occasion without you.

I understand that travelling from Vancouver might be a bit of a journey, so I’ve checked a few nearby hotels that offer discounts for wedding guests. Let me know if you’d like me to help with arrangements — you’re also welcome to stay at my place before the wedding.

I truly hope you can make it. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Warmest wishes,

Emily

## 2. 邀请同事参加公司聚餐

### 题目
You are organizing a dinner for your team at work. Write a letter to invite a colleague. In your letter:

### 范文
Dear Jonathan,

I hope everything’s going smoothly on your end. I’m organizing a team dinner next Friday evening to celebrate the successful completion of our client onboarding project, and I’d love for you to join us.

The dinner will take place at “Saffron Garden,” the Indian restaurant just around the corner from the office. We’ve booked a private room from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. It’ll be an informal gathering — a chance to unwind, enjoy some great food, and reflect on the hard work everyone has put in over the past few weeks.

I know you’ve been working extra hours lately, and this dinner is partly to thank people like you for going above and beyond. I hope you can make it — your sense of humor always lifts the team spirit.

Please let me know by Wednesday so I can finalize the reservation. Hope to see you there!

Best regards,

Melissa

## 3. 邀请邻居参加孩子的生日会
### 题目

You are planning a birthday party for your child. Write a letter to invite your neighbor. In your letter:

- tell them about the party
- explain why you are inviting them
- give party details



### 范文
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Sharma,

I hope you're both doing well. I’m writing to invite you and your son, Rohan, to my daughter Sophie’s birthday party this coming Saturday afternoon.

Sophie is turning six, and we’re hosting a small celebration in our backyard from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. There will be games, snacks, cake, and even a puppet show! Sophie and Rohan have been getting along so well at school lately, and she specifically asked if he could come. It would really make her day to have him there.

We’d also love for you to stay for a cup of tea and chat while the kids play. It’ll be a casual, friendly get-together, and a great chance to get to know each other better as neighbors.

Please let me know if you’re able to join us. We’d be so happy to have you.

Warm regards,

Linda Miller
