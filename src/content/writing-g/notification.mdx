##  1. 通知朋友你搬家了

### 题目：

**You have recently moved to a new city. Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:**

* tell your friend that you have moved
* describe the new place and why you moved there
* invite your friend to visit you


### 范文：

**Dear Sarah,**

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to let you know that I’ve recently moved to Halifax for a new job opportunity. It all happened quite quickly — I was offered a position at a publishing company here, and I thought it would be a great step forward in my career.

The new place is a cozy apartment near the waterfront, with a beautiful view of the harbor and lots of great cafes nearby. The neighborhood is quiet and very friendly, which is a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of downtown Ottawa.

I’d love for you to visit sometime soon! There's a guest room with your name on it, and we can explore the city together — I’ve already discovered a few amazing seafood restaurants you'd absolutely love.

Looking forward to catching up in person. Let me know when you might be free!

Warm wishes,

**Emma**

**Dear Principal James,**

I am writing to inform you that my daughter, Lily Zhang, who is in Grade 4, will be absent from school from April 15th to April 18th due to a family emergency. We have to travel to Montreal to attend a close relative’s funeral and support our extended family during this difficult time.

I understand the importance of regular attendance, and I will ensure that Lily completes all the assignments and homework she may miss during this period. I kindly request her teachers to share any key materials or class notes so that she can stay up to date with her studies.

We deeply appreciate your understanding and support. Lily is a dedicated student, and we will make every effort to minimize any disruption caused by this short absence.

Sincerely,

**Wei Zhang**

**Dear Mr. Patel,**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally inform you that I will be taking my annual vacation from May 6th to May 20th. During this time, I will be traveling with my family to visit relatives overseas.

I have already coordinated with my team to ensure a smooth workflow in my absence. I’ve delegated key tasks to Emily and Jason, and I will complete all urgent assignments before May 3rd. I’ve also prepared a handover document detailing the current status of our projects.

If there is anything that needs my attention before I leave, I’m happy to assist to ensure a seamless transition. Please let me know if there are any concerns or specific tasks you’d like me to prioritize.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

**Sandeep Kumar**
