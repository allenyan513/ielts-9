# 雅思写作-G类-Task 2-环境类范文

## 1. 你认为个人能否保护环境？政府和大公司能否做出改变？
### 题目 1

**Do you agree or disagree: Individuals can do nothing to protect the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.**

### 范文：

It is often argued that environmental protection is the sole responsibility of governments and large corporations, and that individuals cannot make a meaningful impact. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. While institutional efforts are essential, individual actions play a crucial and often underestimated role in protecting the environment.

To begin with, many environmental issues are caused or worsened by everyday personal behaviour. For example, using plastic bags, wasting electricity, or frequently driving personal vehicles all contribute to pollution and carbon emissions. If individuals reduce such habits by recycling, saving energy, and using public transportation, the cumulative effect can be significant.

Moreover, individuals influence government and corporate behaviour. When people support eco-friendly businesses or demand sustainable policies, companies and politicians are more likely to act. In fact, many major environmental policies and green product trends have emerged in response to public pressure or consumer demand.

That being said, it is true that governments and large companies have more resources and power to implement large-scale changes. They can pass laws, invest in clean energy, and develop green technologies. However, these efforts cannot succeed without individual participation and cooperation.

**In conclusion**, I firmly believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting the environment. Lasting change comes from the combined actions of individuals, governments, and businesses working together toward a sustainable future.

## 2. 在你的国家，主要的环境问题是什么？如何解决？
### 题目 2

**What are the main environmental problems in your country and how can they be solved?**

### 范文：

Like many other nations, my country is facing several serious environmental problems. The most prominent ones include air pollution, deforestation, and improper waste disposal. However, each of these issues can be addressed with coordinated efforts from the government, companies, and individuals.

Air pollution is a growing concern, especially in urban areas where traffic and industrial activities are dense. The harmful emissions from vehicles and factories not only affect the environment but also human health. One solution is to invest more in public transportation and promote the use of electric vehicles. In addition, stricter regulations should be enforced on industries to reduce harmful emissions.

Another major issue is deforestation, mainly caused by illegal logging and expanding farmland. Forests are crucial for maintaining ecological balance and fighting climate change. To tackle this, the government must strengthen forest protection laws and offer incentives for tree planting programs. At the same time, public awareness about the importance of forests should be raised through education.

Waste management is also a problem, especially in smaller towns where proper recycling systems are lacking. Many people dispose of their garbage improperly, leading to land and water pollution. Introducing nationwide recycling programs and educating people on waste separation could greatly improve the situation.

**In conclusion**, although my country faces serious environmental challenges, there are practical solutions. With strong policies, public participation, and proper investment, these problems can be effectively reduced, creating a cleaner and healthier environment for all.
