### 范文
Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter that has been affecting my daily life quite significantly—specifically, the frequent loud noises coming from your property during late-night hours.

Over the past few weeks, there have been several occasions when loud music and animated conversations have continued well past midnight. While I completely understand the desire to enjoy one's home, the volume and frequency of the disturbances are making it increasingly difficult for me and my family to get a good night’s sleep. As I have to get up early for work, the lack of rest is starting to take a toll on my health and productivity.

I kindly ask if you could reduce the noise levels after 10 p.m., perhaps by lowering the volume of your music and keeping windows closed during gatherings. I truly believe that a small adjustment would make a big difference.

Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.

Yours sincerely,

John Smith


## 2. 向商店投诉产品质量或服务态度

### 题目

You recently bought a product from a store, but you are not satisfied with the quality of the item or the customer service you received.
Write a letter to the store manager. In your letter:

- describe what you purchased
- explain what the problem is
- suggest what you would like the store to do

Write at least 150 words.

### 范文

Dear Store Manager,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent purchase and the service I received at your Main Street branch.

Last week, I bought a wireless Bluetooth speaker (Model: SoundPro X200) from your electronics section. However, after only two days of minimal use, the speaker began producing static noise and occasionally shuts down without warning. I returned to the store to report the issue, but the staff on duty was unhelpful and dismissive, refusing to offer a replacement or even examine the product.

I expected a higher standard of customer care from such a well-known retailer. Not only did I receive a faulty product, but I was also made to feel as though my concerns were unimportant.

I kindly request a full refund or a replacement unit, and I hope you will speak with your staff to ensure better service in the future. I would appreciate a prompt response.

Yours sincerely,

Emily Dawson


## 2. 向房东投诉房屋设施问题

You are renting an apartment and recently you have experienced several problems with the facilities.
Write a letter to your landlord. In your letter:

- describe the problems

Write at least 150 words.

### 范文

Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about several issues I have been experiencing with the apartment I am currently renting at 12B Greenfield Avenue.

Firstly, the central heating system has not been functioning properly for the past week. Given the current cold weather, this has made the apartment extremely uncomfortable, especially during the night. Secondly, the kitchen faucet has developed a persistent leak, which is not only wasting water but also causing minor flooding on the countertop. Lastly, two of the ceiling lights in the living room have stopped working, despite my attempts to replace the bulbs.

These problems have significantly affected my comfort and daily routine. I would greatly appreciate it if you could arrange for a maintenance technician to address these issues as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Yours sincerely,

Alex Chen

## 向航空公司投诉航班延误或行李丢失

### 题目

You recently took a flight and had a problem with either the delay of the flight or lost luggage.
Write a letter to the airline. In your letter:

- describe what happened
- explain how it affected you
- ask the airline to take action

Write at least 150 words.

### 范文

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction regarding the handling of my luggage during Flight AC732 from Toronto to Vancouver on March 25th.

Upon arrival at Vancouver International Airport, I was informed that my checked baggage had not arrived with the flight. Despite filing a lost luggage report immediately at the baggage services desk, I have yet to receive any update on its whereabouts after three days. The missing suitcase contains essential personal items, including business documents, which I urgently need for a conference I am attending this week.

This situation has caused significant inconvenience, stress, and additional expenses as I had to purchase clothes and toiletries. I expect your airline to not only expedite the search for my luggage but also to reimburse the costs incurred due to this incident.

I would appreciate a prompt response and a clear timeline on when I can expect my belongings to be returned.

Yours faithfully,

David Lin
