Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for all the help you gave me during my move last weekend.

Moving can be incredibly stressful, but your kindness made it so much easier. From helping me pack up my kitchenware to driving that heavy sofa up two flights of stairs — I truly couldn’t have done it without you! Your calm and cheerful attitude also helped me stay positive throughout the whole process.

As a small token of my appreciation, I’d love to invite you over for dinner next week — my treat. Let me know what day works best for you.

Thanks again for being such a wonderful friend.

Warm regards,

Nina

This training will certainly improve the way I handle upcoming projects and collaborate with cross-functional teams. I truly appreciate your support in investing in my professional development.
