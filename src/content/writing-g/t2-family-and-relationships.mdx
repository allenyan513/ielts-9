### 题目 1

**Nowadays, people spend less time with their families. Why is this happening, and what can be done about it?**

### 范文：

In today’s fast-paced world, it is becoming increasingly common for people to spend less time with their families. This trend can be attributed to several social and economic factors, but there are also effective ways to address it.

One major reason for this issue is the growing demand for work. Many people are working long hours or juggling multiple jobs to keep up with the rising cost of living. As a result, they return home exhausted, with little energy left for quality family time. In addition, technological advancements have changed the way people interact. Instead of talking with family members, individuals often spend their free time on phones, social media, or online entertainment, which further reduces meaningful connections.

Another contributing factor is changing lifestyles. In the past, extended families lived together and shared daily routines. Today, nuclear families or individuals living alone are more common, especially in urban areas. This separation makes it harder to maintain close relationships.

To solve this problem, both individuals and governments have roles to play. Companies should promote work-life balance by offering flexible hours or remote working options. Governments could support this by enforcing labor laws that prevent overworking. On a personal level, people should consciously set aside time for family activities, such as shared meals, weekend outings, or device-free evenings.

**In conclusion**, the reduction in family time is driven by work pressure, lifestyle changes, and digital distractions. However, with proper policies and individual effort, people can reconnect and prioritize family in their daily lives.

**Some people think children should obey rules strictly, while others believe they should have freedom to make decisions. Discuss both views.**

### 范文：

Raising children has always been a topic of great debate. While some believe that children should strictly follow rules to develop discipline, others argue that allowing them to make their own decisions encourages independence. Both views have merit and deserve careful consideration.

On one hand, strict rules help children learn structure, respect, and responsibility. When children follow rules, they develop good habits and understand the importance of boundaries. For example, following a set bedtime teaches the value of routine and rest. Supporters of this view argue that a rule-based environment prevents children from making poor choices, especially when they are too young to understand the consequences of their actions.

On the other hand, giving children freedom to make decisions helps them build confidence and critical thinking skills. When children are allowed to make small choices—such as picking their clothes or deciding how to spend their free time—they learn to take responsibility for the outcomes. This approach fosters creativity and self-awareness, which are essential for personal development.

In my opinion, a balanced approach is most effective. Children need rules to ensure safety and stability, but they should also be given age-appropriate freedom to explore and grow. For instance, parents can set clear boundaries but still allow children to express opinions and make choices within those limits.

**In conclusion**, while strict rules provide structure, freedom promotes personal growth. A combination of both approaches can help raise well-rounded, confident, and responsible individuals.
