# 雅思写作-G类-Task 2-消费与广告类范文

## 1. 广告促使人们购买不必要的东西？
### 题目 1

**Do you agree or disagree: Advertising encourages people to buy unnecessary things.**

### 范文：

Advertising is a powerful tool used by companies to promote their products, but many people argue that it often encourages consumers to purchase things they do not really need. I completely agree with this statement, as modern advertising often plays on emotions and creates artificial desires.

First of all, many advertisements are designed to trigger a fear of missing out or to associate products with happiness, success, or social acceptance. For instance, a perfume commercial might suggest that using a certain scent will make someone more attractive or popular. As a result, consumers may feel pressure to buy the product even if they do not need it.

Secondly, advertising often targets children and young people, who may lack the critical thinking skills to recognize marketing tricks. This can lead to unnecessary spending on toys, gadgets, or fashion items simply because they are portrayed as trendy or cool in advertisements.

However, it is fair to say that not all advertising is harmful. Sometimes it helps inform people about useful products or good deals. The problem lies in the way ads are designed to manipulate rather than inform.

**In conclusion**, I strongly believe that advertising often leads people to buy unnecessary items by creating emotional appeal and unrealistic expectations. Consumers should be more aware of these tactics and think carefully before making purchases.

## 2. 是否应该限制广告？
### 题目 2

**Some people think the rise in consumer culture is damaging our society. Discuss.**

### 范文：

Consumer culture has grown rapidly over the past few decades, with people buying more goods and placing greater value on material possessions. While this trend has contributed to economic growth, many argue that it is also harming society in several ways. I believe both sides have valid points.

On the one hand, consumerism helps drive the economy. When people spend money on products and services, businesses grow, jobs are created, and innovation is encouraged. Modern society also benefits from improved living standards and greater access to goods that were once considered luxuries.

On the other hand, there are significant downsides to consumer culture. One major issue is environmental damage. The production and disposal of goods create pollution, waste, and contribute to climate change. Additionally, consumerism often promotes a sense of competition and social comparison. People may feel pressure to keep up with others by buying the latest gadgets or fashion, which can lead to stress and financial problems.

Moreover, some argue that consumer culture shifts focus away from more meaningful values such as family, community, and personal growth. In extreme cases, people define their self-worth by what they own rather than who they are.

**In conclusion**, while consumerism can bring economic benefits and personal convenience, its negative impact on the environment, mental health, and social values cannot be ignored. A more balanced approach that encourages mindful consumption would better serve both individuals and society.
