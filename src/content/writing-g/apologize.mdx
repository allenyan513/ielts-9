### 题目

You recently hosted a party at your house, which caused noise and disturbance to your neighbor.
Write a letter to apologize. In your letter:

- explain the reason for the noise

### 范文
Dear Mr. Jacobs,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for the noise from my house last Saturday evening.

I hosted a small birthday gathering for my sister, and although we tried to keep the volume down, I now realize that the music and laughter may have caused you inconvenience. I completely understand how disturbing it must have been, especially late at night.

Please accept my heartfelt apologies. I assure you that I will be more mindful in the future and will inform you in advance if I ever host another event. I also plan to end any future gatherings at a more reasonable hour to avoid causing further disturbance.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Sincerely,

Jason Lee

### 范文
Dear Emma,

I’m really sorry for cancelling our dinner plans at the last minute yesterday.

Unfortunately, I had an unexpected emergency at work — one of my team members fell ill, and I had to stay late to finish a project before the deadline. I was really looking forward to catching up with you, so I’m truly sorry for the inconvenience.

Would you be free this Friday evening instead? I’d love to make it up to you — dinner’s on me this time.

Looking forward to seeing you soon and hearing all your updates!

Warm wishes,

Rachel
