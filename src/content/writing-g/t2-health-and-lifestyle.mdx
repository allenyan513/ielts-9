# 雅思写作-G类-Task 2-健康与生活方式类范文

## 1. 越来越多的人变得超重。原因是什么？如何解决这个问题？
### 题目 1

**More and more people are becoming overweight. What are the reasons, and how can this problem be solved?**

### 范文:

Obesity has become a widespread issue in many countries, with an increasing number of people becoming overweight. This trend is concerning as it has serious consequences for both individual health and public healthcare systems. In this essay, I will explore the main reasons behind this issue and propose some practical solutions.

One of the primary causes of obesity is the modern sedentary lifestyle. Many people now work in office-based jobs, spend long hours in front of screens, and rarely engage in physical activity. This lack of movement reduces the number of calories burned each day, leading to gradual weight gain over time. Additionally, fast food and processed meals have become more accessible and affordable. These foods are often high in sugar, fat, and calories but low in nutritional value.

Another significant factor is a lack of awareness and education about healthy eating and lifestyle choices. Some individuals may not fully understand how to maintain a balanced diet or how much physical activity is required to stay healthy. In some low-income areas, healthy food may also be harder to find or afford.

To address this issue, governments and schools can play a key role. Public health campaigns can educate citizens about nutrition and exercise. Schools should incorporate more physical education into the curriculum and ensure that only healthy meals are served. Additionally, cities should be designed to encourage walking, cycling, and outdoor activities.

**In conclusion**, the rise in obesity is largely due to poor diet and lack of exercise. With joint efforts from governments, schools, and individuals, this problem can be effectively tackled.

## 2. 学校是否应该禁止不健康食品？
### 题目 2

**Some people think that unhealthy food should be banned from schools. Do you agree or disagree?**

###  范文：

There is growing concern about the availability of unhealthy food in schools, and some people argue that such food should be completely banned from school premises. I fully agree with this idea, as banning junk food in schools can promote healthier habits and reduce the risk of childhood obesity.

Firstly, schools are not just places of academic learning, but also institutions where children develop lifelong habits. If children are consistently exposed to fast food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks at school, they may begin to view such items as acceptable or even normal parts of a daily diet. Removing these options encourages students to eat more nutritious meals and develop better eating habits.

Secondly, childhood obesity is a serious and growing issue in many countries. It can lead to a range of long-term health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and low self-esteem. By banning unhealthy food in schools, we can help reduce caloric intake and promote healthier lifestyles among young people. When students eat better, they also tend to focus better in class and perform better academically.

However, it is important to note that simply banning unhealthy food is not enough. Schools should also educate students about nutrition and involve parents in promoting healthy choices at home. School canteens should offer affordable, appealing, and healthy alternatives so that students do not feel deprived.

**In conclusion**, banning unhealthy food in schools is a necessary step toward protecting children’s health. Combined with education and positive reinforcement, such a ban can lead to long-lasting benefits for both individuals and society.
