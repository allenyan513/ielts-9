### 范文
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing in response to your recent advertisement for a receptionist at your hotel. I am very interested in applying for this position as I believe it aligns perfectly with my background in customer service and my enthusiasm for the hospitality industry.

I have over three years of experience working as a front-desk assistant at a busy travel agency, where I managed bookings, greeted customers, and handled phone and email inquiries. I have strong communication skills, a friendly demeanor, and I am fluent in both English and French, which I believe is valuable in a multicultural environment like yours.

I would be grateful if you could let me know more about the application process and whether there are any additional documents I should prepare. I am available for an interview at your convenience and would be happy to provide references upon request.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Rachel Lin

### 范文
Dear Mr. Thompson,

I am writing to formally inform you of my decision to resign from my position as Marketing Assistant at BrightEdge Ltd., effective two weeks from today.

This decision was not made lightly, but after careful consideration, I have decided to pursue further studies in digital marketing to enhance my career prospects. I believe this is the right time to invest in professional development, which unfortunately requires me to leave my current role.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunities and support you have provided over the past two years. Working with such a talented and cooperative team has been a truly rewarding experience.

To ensure a smooth transition, I am happy to assist in training my replacement and to document any ongoing tasks that need handover. Please let me know how I can best support the team during this time.

Thank you once again for everything.

Yours sincerely,
David Park


##  3. 请求调岗或工作调整
### 题目：
You are not satisfied with your current job role and would like to request a transfer to another department. Write a letter to your manager. In your letter:

- explain your current position and why it is not suitable
- state the department or role you wish to transfer to
- explain how the change would benefit you and the company

### 范文：
Dear Ms. Roberts,

I am writing to formally request a transfer from my current position as a Customer Support Representative to the Marketing Department at our company.

While I have enjoyed working in customer service for the past year, I have realized that my true interests and skills lie in content creation and market research. I recently completed a certification in Digital Marketing, and I believe I could contribute more effectively in a creative and analytical role.

The Marketing Department recently posted an opening for a Junior Content Analyst, and I feel my background in customer interactions could bring valuable insights into content strategies. Moreover, this transition would allow me to continue growing professionally within the company rather than seeking opportunities elsewhere.

I hope you will consider my request, and I am happy to discuss this further at your convenience.

Kind regards,

Samuel Chen

Once I have this information, I will be in a position to make a final decision. I expect to provide you with a definitive response by the end of this week.

Thank you again, and I look forward to your reply.
