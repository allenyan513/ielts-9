# 雅思写作-G类-Task 2-科技与社会类范文

## 1.科技是否让人们更加孤立?

### 题目 1

**Do you think the development of technology is making people more isolated?**

### 范文：

Technology has transformed the way we communicate, work, and socialize. While it brings many conveniences, there is a growing concern that it is making people more isolated. In my view, although technology can contribute to isolation in some cases, it largely depends on how it is used.

On the one hand, there is evidence that excessive use of technology, especially smartphones and social media, can reduce face-to-face interactions. Many people now prefer texting or browsing social media rather than meeting in person. In public places, it’s common to see individuals absorbed in their devices instead of engaging with those around them. Over time, this can weaken personal relationships and lead to feelings of loneliness.

However, technology can also bring people closer, especially those who live far apart. For example, video calls allow families and friends in different countries to stay in touch easily. Online platforms also help people find communities and connect with others who share similar interests, including those who might otherwise feel isolated due to age, disability, or location.

In my opinion, the key lies in balance. Technology should be used to enhance, not replace, real human connection. People must learn to set boundaries, such as turning off devices during meals or social events.

**In conclusion**, while technology can lead to isolation if misused, it also has the potential to connect people in powerful ways. It is our responsibility to use it wisely and maintain meaningful social interactions.

## 2.手机对儿童的影响

### 题目 2

**Many people think that mobile phones are harmful to children. Do you agree or disagree?**

### 范文：

The use of mobile phones among children has become increasingly common, raising concerns among parents and educators. While mobile phones offer some benefits, I strongly agree that their excessive or unsupervised use can be harmful to children’s development.

Firstly, mobile phones can negatively impact children’s physical and mental health. Spending long hours on screens can lead to eye strain, poor sleep, and reduced physical activity. Moreover, children may become addicted to games or social media, which can harm their ability to focus and increase anxiety or depression.

Secondly, mobile phones can expose children to inappropriate content or online dangers. Without proper supervision, they may encounter cyberbullying, harmful videos, or be contacted by strangers. Younger children are especially vulnerable because they lack the judgment to recognize and avoid such risks.

Additionally, excessive mobile phone use may reduce the time children spend interacting with their family, playing outdoors, or reading. These traditional activities are essential for their emotional growth and social skills.

That being said, mobile phones can be useful if used appropriately. They allow children to contact their parents in emergencies, access educational resources, and stay connected with friends. Therefore, the issue is not the phone itself, but how it is used and monitored.

**In conclusion**, I believe that mobile phones can be harmful to children if used without clear rules or guidance. Parents should set limits and ensure that mobile use is safe, balanced, and age-appropriate.


## 3.社交媒体的影响

### 题目 3

**What problems does social media cause in our society, and what can be done to solve them?**

### 范文：

Social media has dramatically changed how people communicate and consume information. While it has many positive aspects, it also creates several problems for individuals and society. Fortunately, there are ways to address these issues.

One major problem is the spread of misinformation. Because anyone can post content, false or misleading information can go viral quickly, especially during elections or health crises. This can lead to confusion, fear, and even dangerous behavior, such as refusing vaccines or believing in conspiracy theories.

Another issue is the negative impact on mental health. Many people, especially teenagers, compare themselves to others on social media and feel inadequate or anxious. Cyberbullying is also widespread, with harmful comments or rumors affecting victims’ well-being.

In addition, social media can reduce productivity and damage real-life relationships. People may spend hours scrolling instead of working or spending time with family and friends.

To solve these problems, governments and tech companies should work together to regulate content and improve digital literacy. Social media platforms must take more responsibility by removing harmful content and limiting the spread of fake news. Schools should teach students how to use social media critically and responsibly.

**In conclusion**, while social media offers many benefits, it also causes serious problems such as misinformation and mental health issues. Through better regulation, education, and awareness, we can minimize these negative effects and create a healthier digital environment.
