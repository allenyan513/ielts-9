## 1. 向旅游公司建议改进行程安排


### 题目
You recently went on a group tour organized by a travel company. You felt the itinerary could be improved.
Write a letter to the company. In your letter:

- describe the tour and when it took place
- explain what you liked and what you didn’t like about it
- make suggestions for improvement

### 范文
Dear Sir or Madam,

I recently participated in your 5-day “Historic Cities of Italy” tour from April 12th to 16th, and while I enjoyed many aspects of the trip, I believe there is room for improvement.

The guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and I particularly appreciated the walking tour of Florence. However, I found the overall schedule quite rushed, especially on the third day when we visited both Pisa and Siena in just a few hours. This left very little time to explore or rest, and several participants felt exhausted by the end of the day.

I would suggest extending the tour by one day or reducing the number of daily destinations. Allowing more free time for meals and sightseeing would greatly enhance the experience for future travellers.

Thank you for organizing a memorable trip. I hope my feedback is helpful for planning future tours.

Yours faithfully,

Emily Clarke

## 2. 向图书馆提出增加学习资源的建议

### 题目
You are a student and use the university library regularly. You would like to suggest some improvements to the library.
Write a letter to the librarian. In your letter:

- explain who you are and why you use the library
- describe the issue you are experiencing
- suggest how the library could be improved

### 范文
Dear Library Manager,

My name is Daniel Lim, a second-year Business student at the university. I frequently use the campus library to study and complete group assignments, especially in the evenings and on weekends.

While I appreciate the quiet environment and the helpful staff, I’ve noticed that there’s a limited number of up-to-date textbooks and e-resources for marketing and finance courses. Many books are either outdated or constantly on loan, which makes research quite challenging during peak times.

I suggest the library consider subscribing to more digital academic journals and expanding the selection of course-specific e-books. In addition, a system that allows students to request specific materials could help the library better understand student needs.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope these suggestions will be considered.

Yours sincerely,

Daniel Lim

## 3. 向老板建议改善工作流程
### 题目
You want to suggest an improvement to the current work process in your company.
Write a letter to your manager. In your letter:

- describe the current process
- explain what problems it causes
- suggest how to improve it

### 范文
Dear Ms. Roberts,

I’m writing to share a suggestion regarding our internal reporting process, particularly the weekly sales report submission.

Currently, each team compiles their own report manually and submits it via email. This often results in inconsistent formats, delayed submissions, and time-consuming compilation on your end. I believe this could be streamlined to improve both accuracy and efficiency.

I recommend we adopt a shared Google Sheets template where each team can input their figures by a set deadline. This would allow real-time updates, standardize the format, and reduce the need for back-and-forth emails.

If you’re open to the idea, I’d be happy to create a prototype and present it at our next team meeting.

Kind regards,

Kevin Tran
