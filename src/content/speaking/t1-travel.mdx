# 雅思口语-Task 1-旅行类范文


## 1. **Do you like to travel?**

Yes, I absolutely love traveling. It gives me a chance to step out of my routine, experience different cultures, and try new food. I find it refreshing and often come back with a new perspective on life. Whether it’s exploring a bustling city or hiking through nature, I always feel inspired when I’m on the road.

## 2. **Where did you go on your last vacation?**

My last vacation was to Banff National Park in Alberta. It was breathtaking — the turquoise lakes, the snow-capped mountains, and the wildlife all made it an unforgettable experience. I spent a few days hiking, kayaking, and just enjoying the fresh mountain air. It was the perfect escape from city life and also a great way to recharge.


My last vacation was to Orlando, Florida, which is famous for its theme parks. I went there mainly to visit Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, and it truly lived up to the hype. I spent several days exploring the different parks, enjoying the rides, and even trying some unique local food. What I liked most was the energy of the place — it’s designed for fun, and you can’t help but feel like a kid again. It was a perfect mix of excitement and relaxation, and I’d definitely love to go back someday.

## 3. **Do you prefer to travel alone or with friends?**

It depends on the destination and my mood, but generally, I enjoy traveling with friends. Sharing experiences makes the trip more memorable, and there’s always someone to take photos for you! That said, I’ve also traveled solo, and I think it’s a valuable experience — it gives you complete freedom and pushes you to be more independent.
