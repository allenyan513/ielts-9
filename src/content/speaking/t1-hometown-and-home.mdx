# 雅思口语-Task 1-家乡和家范文

## 1. **Where are you from?**

I’m originally from Suzhou, a historic city in eastern China. It’s known for its classical gardens, silk industry, and beautiful canals, which is why some people call it the “Venice of the East.” I’ve lived there most of my life, and it has always felt like a perfect blend of tradition and modern development. It’s also just a short train ride from Shanghai, so it’s very accessible.


## 2. **Can you tell me about your hometown?**

Sure. My hometown, Suzhou, is famous for its traditional Chinese gardens, many of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites. It’s also a hub of cultural heritage, with centuries-old architecture, temples, and ancient city walls. In recent years, it has grown rapidly, and now you’ll find a modern skyline standing side by side with ancient alleys. What I love most is that despite the rapid modernization, the city has managed to preserve its unique charm and historical identity.


## 3. **Do you live in a house or an apartment?**

At the moment, I live in an apartment in a high-rise building. It’s on the 12th floor, so I have a great view of the city skyline. Although it’s not very spacious, it’s quite comfortable and has all the amenities I need. I prefer apartment living because it’s more convenient in the city — everything from supermarkets to public transport is just a short walk away.


## 4. **What do you like about your hometown?**

One of the things I appreciate most about Suzhou is its peaceful atmosphere despite being a relatively large city. The gardens and canals provide a sense of calm, and there are plenty of places to relax or go for a walk. I also love the local food — it’s slightly sweet and very flavorful, with specialties like sweet and sour mandarin fish and sticky rice cakes. Plus, the people are generally warm and polite, which makes it a pleasant place to live.
