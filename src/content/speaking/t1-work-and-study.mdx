# 雅思口语-Task 1-工作和学习类范文

## 1. **What is your job?**

I work as a software engineer. My main responsibilities involve designing and developing applications, mostly web-based solutions. I’m currently part of a team that builds scalable backend systems using modern technologies like Node.js and cloud platforms such as AWS. It’s a dynamic role that requires constant learning, but that’s one of the things I enjoy about it.


## 2. **Why did you choose this job?**

I chose this profession because I’ve always been passionate about creating things — building software is, in a way, like crafting something from scratch. I love the idea that my code can turn into a real product that people use in their daily lives. Plus, software engineering offers endless opportunities to innovate, solve problems, and continuously improve my skills.


## 3. **What do you study?**

I studied computer science at university, where I focused on areas like algorithms, data structures, and system design. After graduating, I’ve continued learning on my own through online courses and certifications. In this industry, technology evolves so fast that continuous learning is almost a requirement, not just an option.

## 4. **Do you enjoy your studies?**

Absolutely. I’ve always enjoyed learning, especially when the knowledge can be directly applied to real-world problems. Studying computer science gave me a strong foundation, and I still find it satisfying to explore new programming languages, frameworks, or architectural concepts. Even now, I spend time each week reading tech blogs or experimenting with new tools — it keeps me motivated and up to date.
