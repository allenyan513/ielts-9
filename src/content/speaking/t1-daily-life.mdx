# 雅思口语-Task 1-日常生活类范文


## 1. **What do you do in your free time?**

In my free time, I usually try to unwind and recharge. I enjoy going for walks in the park or along the riverside near my apartment, especially in the late afternoon. If the weather isn't great, I stay in and watch documentaries or listen to podcasts — I’m particularly interested in topics like psychology and current affairs. I also try to stay active, so I often do some light workouts at home.

## 2. **What kinds of hobbies do you have?**

I’ve always had a variety of hobbies. One of my main interests is photography — I love capturing moments when I travel or even just around the city. I also enjoy learning languages, which is both fun and useful. Recently, I’ve been trying my hand at cooking different cuisines, and it’s become quite a relaxing hobby for me. I like the sense of creativity it gives me.

## 3. **How do you usually spend your weekends?**

Weekends are when I try to strike a balance between rest and productivity. On Saturday mornings, I usually run errands or do house chores. In the afternoon, I might meet up with friends for lunch or coffee. Sundays are typically quieter — I’ll catch up on reading or plan for the week ahead. I try not to overschedule my weekends so that I have time to relax and reset.

## 4. **Do you enjoy reading? What kind of books do you like?**

Yes, I love reading. I find it’s a great way to escape reality and expand my perspective. I’m especially drawn to historical fiction and contemporary novels, but I also enjoy non-fiction books related to psychology or personal development. One of my recent favorites was *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari — it gave me a completely new way of thinking about human history and society.
