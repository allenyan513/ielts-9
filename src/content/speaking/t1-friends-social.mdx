# 雅思口语-Task 1-朋友和社交类范文


## 1. Do you prefer spending time with friends or family?
That’s a tough question because both are important to me. However, if I had to choose, I’d say I slightly prefer spending time with my family. Since I live far from them, every moment we get to share feels more meaningful. That said, I truly value my friendships as well — they provide a different kind of support and fun that I also need in my life.

## 2. How often do you meet your friends?
I try to meet my close friends at least once or twice a week. Sometimes we just hang out at someone’s place or go out for dinner. Of course, when we’re all busy with work, we keep in touch through messages or quick calls. I think maintaining regular contact, even if it’s not face-to-face, is really important in keeping a friendship strong.

## 3. What do you usually do when you meet your friends?
It depends on the mood and the weather, honestly. If it’s nice out, we might go for a hike or grab some coffee downtown. Other times, we just chill at someone’s house, cook something together, and catch up. Occasionally, we go to the movies or attend local events. For me, it’s more about the company than the activity.
