### 范文

One of the most valuable pieces of advice I’ve ever received came from my university professor, Dr. Wilson, during my final year of computer science. At that time, I was feeling quite anxious about my future career and uncertain whether I should take a stable job offer or pursue my dream of building a software product from scratch.

Dr. Wilson advised me to **focus on creating value rather than chasing short-term rewards**. He told me that if I worked on something meaningful that solved real problems, success—both financial and personal—would eventually follow. He gave me this advice during a one-on-one career counselling session, and it really stuck with me.

I remember feeling both inspired and relieved. It helped shift my mindset from fear and self-doubt to purpose and passion. Because of his advice, I turned down the traditional job offer and began working on a mobile app idea I had been thinking about for months. Although the road was challenging, that decision led me to become a software engineer with entrepreneurial experience—and eventually move to Canada to continue my work.

Looking back, I’m extremely grateful for his words. They gave me the confidence to take a risk and follow a path that felt authentic to me.
